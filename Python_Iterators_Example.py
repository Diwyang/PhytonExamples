# My Python Iterators Example 

""" An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.

An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.

Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
 """

#Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

#All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator
#Return an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

#Strings are also iterable objects, containing a sequence of characters:
mystr = "banana"
myit = iter(mystr)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

#Create an Iterator
print("Create an Iterator")
#To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
#Create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter)) 

print("StopIteration")
#StopIteration
#The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a for loop.
#To prevent the iteration to go on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.
#In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    if self.a <= 20:
      x = self.a
      self.a += 1
      return x
    else:
      raise StopIteration

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

for x in myiter:
  print(x)
